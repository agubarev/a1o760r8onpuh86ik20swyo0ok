# Test task solution

The comprehension, implementation and testing was done over 3 days, with interruptions, using my spare moments, totalling to about 7 to 9 hours hands-on.

#### A few comments regarding the implementation approach:
- only `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` transactions are tracked for handling,
- recurring transaction IDs are permitted due to simplicity and scope of this task,
- errors are accounted for but not handled nor logged due to presented execution syntax, i.e., without `tee`ing std(out|err),
- errors are ignored but do not affect the state of the program,
- I'll be glad to answer any possible specific questions.
